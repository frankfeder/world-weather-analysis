# World Weather Analysis
This repo is a workspace for experimenting with pulling data from the Open Weather Map API, and then creating heatmaps, markers, and directions on an interactive google maps ("gmaps") visualization within the iPython notebook.

To run this code on your own, you'll need to add a config.py file to the directory of the iPython notebook that contains your own API keys for Open Weather Maps or Google Maps, in variables called "weather_api_key" and "g_key" respectively.
